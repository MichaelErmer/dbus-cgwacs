dbus-cgwacs
===========

Reads energy measuremens from Carlo Gavazzi Wired AC Sensors (hence cgwacs),
and puts in on the D-Bus. At this point only the EM24 model is supported.

Architecture
============

The application consists of several layers:
* Data acquisition layer:
    - The _ModbusRtu_ class provides a simple implementation of the modbus
      RTU protocol, which supports the functions ReadHoldingRegisters (3),
      ReadInputRegisters (4) and WriteSingleRegister (6) only.
    - _AcSensorUpdater_ connects to an ac sensor, retrieves its identity
      (type & serial) and retrieves measured data. The data retrieved will be
      stored in an _AcSensor_ object.
* Data model
    - _AcSensor_ contains the latest measurements taken from an AC sensor.
    - _Settings_ Persistent settings objects which contains global settings.
    - _AcSensorSettings_ Persistent AC sensor settings.
* D-Bus layer
    - _AcSensorBridge_ produces the _com.victronenergy.grid.ttyUSB??_ D-Bus
      service. Information is taken from an _AcSensor_, and an
      _AcSensorSettings_ object.
    - _AcSensorSettingsBridge_ consumes a subtree from the local settings.
      Path: /Settings/CGwacs/D[serial]

Finally _AcSensorMediator_ ties everything together.
